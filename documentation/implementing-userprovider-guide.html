        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            This is a guide for developers that wish to integrate Openfire with an external system that provides user
            definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beware that this integration can be used to provision Openfire with user data, but critically, does not
            implement authentication. For that, please refer to the
            <a href="implementing-authprovider-guide.html">Custom Authentication Provider Guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This integration requires some Java knowledge in order to implement a custom user provider
            for Openfire. The skill needed will vary depending on what you are trying to achieve.

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
            Under standard configuration, Openfire maintains user data in its own database tables. Various
            alternatives to this are offered that allow you to <a href="ldap-guide.html">use users defined in Active Directory or LDAP</a>
            or <a href="db-integration-guide.html#user-integration">obtaining users from custom database tables</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in integrating with a system that is not compatible with the standard integration
            options that are provided by Openfire, then you can implement a custom integration. This guide will help you
            get started!

        <h2>The UserProvider extension point</h2>

        <p>
            Openfire's API defines the <a href="javadoc/org/jivesoftware/openfire/user/UserProvider.html">UserProvider</a>
            interface, which is the extension point to use when implementing custom user functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default implementation of this provider is the <code>DefaultUserProvider</code>, which as the name
            suggests is the version of this provider Openfire will use if not overridden. It uses the
            <code>ofUser</code>, <code>ofUserFlag</code> and <code>ofUserProp</code> database tables.
        </p>
        <p>
           The steps to get Openfire using a custom <code>UserProvider</code> are described below.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Write a class that implements <code>UserProvider</code>, providing your own business logic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the class available in a jar and make this available to Openfire by placing it in the lib directory.
                Why not use an Openfire plugin, you ask? Read the FAQ entry below! There are numerous ways to package a
                jar with this class inside it, popular build systems such as Gradle and Maven can make your life easier.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the property <code>provider.user.className</code> to be the full name of your class, e.g.
                <code>org.example.user.FooUserProvider</code>. You can easily do this by defining such a property in the
                <code>conf/openfire.xml</code> configuration file, as shown below.
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>Example openfire.xml configuration snippet</legend>
                    <pre><code>&lt;provider&gt;
    &lt;user&gt;
        &lt;className&gt;org.example.user.FooUserProvider&lt;/className&gt;
    &lt;/user&gt;
&lt;/provider&gt;</code></pre>
                </fieldset>
            </li>
            <li>
                Restart Openfire. Your custom class should now be providing users to Openfire.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It is worth noting that the <code>UserProvider</code> interface defines an interface that can be used to
            both read data from, but also write data back to the system that is being integrated with. If the system
            that you're integrating with can not or must not have its user definitions changed, you can implement your
            provider as being 'read-only'.
        </p>
        <p>
            To mark your provider as being read-only, implement the <code>isReadOnly()</code> method to return the value
            <code>true</code>. All methods that would cause a change of data won't be invoked by Openfire if you do so.
            These methods should receive an implementation that throws <code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A similar approach (throwing <code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>) can be used to prevent
            implementing optional functionality, such as the support for search functionality.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h4>Do I have to compile my custom class into the Openfire jar?</h4>
        <p>
            No, the class only needs to be visible on the Openfire classpath.
        </p>

        <h4>How do I ensure my custom class is visible on the Openfire classpath?</h4>
        <p>
            Just place your new custom library in the Openfire lib directory, this will ensure it is automatically
            available at startup.
        </p>

        <h4>Should I include all the dependencies that my code needs?</h4>
        <p>
            Yes, and no. Your code will run using the same classpath as Openfire. Openfire's dependencies are already on
            that classpath. If your code uses the same dependencies, you do not need to include them again. You can add
            other dependencies, either by packaging them in your jar file, or by placing them in the openfire lib folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beware of conflicting dependencies! Sometimes, packaging dependencies in an all-containing jar, and renaming
            the packages of those dependencies (<em>shade</em> them), can be helpful.
        </p>

        <h4>Isn't it easier to deploy my code as an Openfire plugin?</h4>
        <p>
            It is not recommended to use a plugin for packaging and deploying your provider. For one, plugins use a
            dedicated class path. For another, the load order of plugins could lead to hairy scenarios, and finally:
            plugins can be <em>unloaded</em> at runtime. This all could lead to a running Openfire service for which you
            cannot guarantee that your provider is loaded at all times. For these reasons, we recommend creating a jar
            file instead of an Openfire plugin, and placing that jar file in Openfire's lib directory!
        </p>

        <h4>Can I see some examples?</h4>
        <p>
            Openfire's own user functionality makes use of the <code>UserProvider</code> API! If you want to get
            some inspiration, you can have a look at the implementations of this interface that are part of Openfire,
            such as the ones below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>org.jivesoftware.openfire.user.DefaultUserProvider</code> - used as the default provider.</li>
            <li><code>org.jivesoftware.openfire.user.JDBCUserProvider</code> - integrates with a custom database.</li>
            <li><code>org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapUserProvider</code> - used when Openfire is configured to integrate with Active Directory or LDAP.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that these providers are but a sample of the available providers. Discover more providers by using your
            IDE to find implementations of the interface!
        </p>

        <h4>Will I have a degradation in performance using a custom UserProvider?</h4>
        <p>
            It completely depends on your implementation. As with any Openfire customisation or plugin, badly written
            code has the potential to cause Openfire to perform slower. Use performance testing tools such as Tsung to
            ensure issues haven't been introduced.
        </p>

        <h4>How can I have my custom class connect to another DB/Web service/NoSQL store etc?</h4>
        <p>
            This is out of the scope of this documentation and is your choice as a developer. If you are looking to
            externalize properties like connection details, the Openfire properties mechanism and the JiveGlobals class
            are good places to start investigating.
