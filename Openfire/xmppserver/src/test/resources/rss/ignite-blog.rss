			<title>CVE-2023-32315: Openfire vulnerability (update)</title>

				<![CDATA[
            <p>A few months ago, we <a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/cve-2023-32315-openfire-administration-console-authentication-bypass/">published details</a> about an important security vulnerability in Openfire that is identified as CVE-2023-32315.</p><p>To summarize: Openfire’s administrative console (the Admin Console), a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated user to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users.</p><p>Leveraging this, a malicious actor can gain access to all of Openfire, and, by extension (through installing custom plugins), much of the infrastructure that is used to run Openfire. The Ignite Realtime community has made available new Openfire releases in which the issue is addressed, and published various mitigation strategies for those who cannot immediately apply an update. Details can be found in <a href="https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/security/advisories/GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm">the security advisory</a> that we released back in May.</p><p>In the last few days, this issue has seen a considerable increase in exposure: there have been numerous articles and podcasts that discuss the vulnerability. Many of these seem to refer back to a recent blogpost by <a href="https://vulncheck.com/blog/openfire-cve-2023-32315">Jacob Banes at Vulncheck.com</a>, and those that do not seem to include very similar content.</p><p>Many of these articles point out that there’s a “new way” to exploit the vulnerability. We indeed see that there are various methods being used, in the wild, in which this vulnerability is abused. Some of these methods leave less traces than others, but the level of access that can be obtained through each of these methods is pretty similar (and, sadly, similarly severe).</p><p>Given the renewed attention, we’d like to make clear that there is no <em>new</em> vulnerability in Openfire. The issue, solutions and mitigations that are documented in the original security advisory are still accurate and up to date.</p><p>Malicous actors use a significant amount of automation. By now, it’s almost safe to assume that your instance has been compromised if you’re running an unpatched instance of Openfire that has its administrative console exposed to the unrestricted internet. Tell-tale signs are high CPU loads (of crypto-miners being installed) and the appearance of new plugins (which carry the malicious code), but this by no means is true for every system that’s compromised.</p><p>We continue to urge everyone to <strong>update Openfire</strong> to its last release, and carefully review <a href="https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/security/advisories/GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm">the security advisory</a> that we released back in May, to apply applicable mitigations where possible.</p><p>For other release announcements and news follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/IgniteRealtime">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://toot.igniterealtime.org/@news">Mastodon</a>.</p><p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p><p><a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/cve-2023-32315-openfire-vulnerability-update/93166">Read full topic</a></p>

            <p>I have been recently working on a proprietary Openfire commercial plugin for Openfire that integrates XMPP with Azure Communication Services (ACS).</p><p>This plugin adds support for a whole range of modern web service connections to Openfire/XMPP via the embedded Jetty web server in a different way to the traditional persistent client XMPP session over TCP/5222 or Bosh/7443 or Websockets/7443 used by native binary clients.</p><p>It uses :</p><ul><li>JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) instead of traditional username/passwords combined with Web Authentication and Web Credentials to authenticate user requests and manage the user permissions and entitlements that apply for the request or entitlement.</li><li>REST APIs to make requests and receive immediate responses.</li><li>Server Sent Events (SSE) and</li><li>Web-Push to push events to users when they are online or offline.</li></ul><p>A user has a singleton xmpp session in Openfire that is created on demand and removed when it expires. This single user session can have many active REST and SSE connections depending on how many browsers tabs, browser windows or browser instances are connected to Openfire from applications in web pages opened on behalf of the user.</p><p>The xmpp session has the full feature set of an XMPP client that is based on Smack/Spark. It also has User Interface (UI) consisting of web-components that can bind directly to Spark features. For example, a contacts roster widget and a chat conversation widget. that work independent of each other and can be hosted in different web pages or different browsers but end up pointing at the same xmpp session.</p><p>A fully working XMPP client can be constructed in a web page with minimal HTML and JavaScript.</p><p>Over the next few weeks and months in my spare time, I will be extracting the open source aspects of the commercial plugin in to a new Openfire plugin I have aptly named SparkWeb.</p><p>Please post any comments or feedback if you want to get involved or want to influence the development of this community plugin,. Now is the time to get your ideas and suggestions in.</p><p>For other release announcements and news follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/IgniteRealtime">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://toot.igniterealtime.org/@news">Mastodon</a>.</p><p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p><p><a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/sparkweb-lives-again/93130">Read full topic</a></p>

            <p>The Ignite Realtime Community is pleased to announce the first release of <a href="https://igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=galene">Galene plugin for Openfire</a></p><p><a href="https://galene.org/">Galene</a> is technically an audio/video SFU like Jitsi, however it handles a different use case from Jitsi. While Jitsi does audio/video conferencing very well with bi-directional media streams for an equal number of speakers and listeners, Galene does webinars and lectures much better with single uni-drectional streams for very few speakers and a larger number of listeners.</p><p>This plugin hosts a Galene server and also implements an <a href="https://igniterealtime.github.io/openfire-galene-plugin/xep/xep-xxx-sfu_01-01.xml">XEP for in-band SFU sessions</a> that I am currently working on. This XEP is used  by the <a href="https://igniterealtime.org/projects/pade/">Pàdé client</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/conversejs/community-plugins/tree/master/packages/galene#readme">Galene ConverseJS community plugin.</a> for supporting audio/video in webinars and lectures.</p><p>For other release announcements and news follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/IgniteRealtime">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://toot.igniterealtime.org/@news">Mastodon</a>.</p><p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p><p><a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/galene-openfire-plugin-release-0-0-3/93120">Read full topic</a></p>

            <p>The Ignite Realtime Community is happy to announce the <code>4.6.8</code> release of Openfire!</p><p>We have made available a new release of this older version to addresses the issue that is subject of <a href="https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/security/advisories/GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm">security advisory CVE-2023-32315</a>.</p><p>We are aware that for some, the process of deploying a new major version of Openfire is not a trivial matter, as it may encompass a lot more than only performing the update of the executables. Depending on regulations that are in place, this process can require a lot of effort and take a long time to complete. To facilitate users that currently use an older version of Openfire, we are also making available this new release in the older 4.6 branch of Openfire. An upgrade to this version will, for some, require a lot less effort. Note well: although we are making available a new version in the 4.6 branch of Openfire, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of Openfire (currently in the 4.7 branch), as that includes important fixes and improvements that are not available in 4.6.</p><p>You can find download artifacts <a href="https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/releases/tag/v4.6.8">available here</a> with the following <code>sha256sum</code> values</p><pre><code class="lang-auto">aa1947097895a6d41bc8d1ac29f6ea60507bce69caadc497b4794a2a4110dc20  openfire-4.6.8-1.i686.rpm

				<![CDATA[
            <p>We are happy to announce the immediate availability of a new version of the MUC Real-Time Block List plugin for <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/">Openfire</a>, our cross-platform real-time collaboration server based on the XMPP protocol! This plugin can help you moderate your chat rooms, especially when your service is part of a larger network of federated XMPP domains.</p><p>From experience, the XMPP community has learned that bad actors tend to spam a wide range of public chat rooms on an equally wide range of different domains. Prior to the functionality provided by this plugin, the administrator of each MUC service had to manually adjust permissions, to keep unwanted entities out. With this new plugin, that process is automated.</p><p>In this new release, several small bugs were fixed, and new features were introduced, including:</p><ul><li>The plugin now, by default, uses a block list as maintained on <a href="https://xmppbl.org/">https://xmppbl.org/</a></li><li>Support for blocking full domains (rather than just individual users) has been added</li><li>Block list entries no longer disappear over time</li></ul><p>The updated plugin should become available for download in your Openfire admin console in the course of the next few hours. Alternatively, you can download the plugin directly, from <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=mucrtbl">the plugin’s archive page</a>.</p><p>For other release announcements and news follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/IgniteRealtime">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://toot.igniterealtime.org/@news">Mastodon</a>.</p><p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p><p><a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/release-v1-1-0-of-the-muc-real-time-block-list-plugin-for-openfire/92673">Read full topic</a></p>

            <p>We am excited to announce that a new plugin for the <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/">Openfire</a> real time collaboration server is in the works! This plugin implements <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/exi/">Efficient XML Interchange (EXI)</a> functionality and provides an XMPP implementation of EXI as defined in <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0322.html">XEP-0322</a>.</p><p>Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) is a binary XML format for exchange of data on a computer network. It is one of the most prominent efforts to encode XML documents in a binary data format, rather than plain text. Using EXI format reduces the verbosity of XML documents as well as the cost of parsing.</p><p>EXI is useful for:</p><ul><li>a complete range of XML document sizes, from dozens of bytes to terabytes</li><li>reducing computational overhead to speed up parsing of compressed documents</li><li>increasing endurance of small devices by utilizing efficient decompression</li></ul><p>Read more about EXI in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_XML_Interchange">Wikipedia article</a> (where the above definition was taken from).</p><p>The plugin that we’re developing today was first created by Javier Placencio, in 2013 and 2014. In 2023, that now dormant <a href="https://github.com/javpla/openfire">project</a> was forked by the Ignite Realtime community.</p><p>Work on the plugin is progressing steadily. Most of the core functionality is believed to be ready. In preparation for the official release of the plugin, we are looking for opportunities to perform interoperability testing. So far, testing has been done with our own mock client implementations. To be able to release a fully functional plugin, we’d like to test against implementations of other authors. Development builds of the plugin can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=EXI">the Openfire EXI plugin archive page</a>.</p><p>Are you interested in this? Please reach out to us on the <a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org">Ignite Realtime Community</a>, or stop by the <a href="https://igniterealtime.org/support/group_chat.jsp">open chat</a>! We would love to hear from you!</p><p>For other release announcements and news follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/IgniteRealtime">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://toot.igniterealtime.org/@news">Mastodon</a>.</p><p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p><p><a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/developing-openfire-efficient-xml-interchange-exi-functionality/92663">Read full topic</a></p>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[
            <p>A new plugin has been made available for Openfire, our cross-platform real-time collaboration server based on the XMPP protocol. We have named this new plugin the MUC Real-Time Block List plugin.</p><p>This plugin can help you moderate your chat rooms, especially when your service is part of a larger network of federated XMPP domains. From experience, the XMPP community has learned that bad actors tend to spam a wide range of public chat rooms on an equally wide range of different domains. Prior to the functionality provided by this plugin, the administrator of each MUC service had to manually adjust permissions, to keep unwanted entities out. With this new plugin, that process is automated.</p><p>This plugin can be used to subscribe to a Publish/Subscribe node (as defined in <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">XEP-0060</a>), that can live on a remote XMPP domain, but curated by a trusted (group of) administrators). It is expected that this node contains a list of banned entities. When Openfire, through the plugin, is notified that the list has received a new banned entity, it will prevent that entity from joining a chat room in Openfire (if they’re already in, they will be kicked out automatically). Using this mechanism, moderation efforts centralized in one federated Pub/Sub service can be used by any server that uses this plugin.</p><p>This plugin is heavily inspired, and aspires to be compatible with, <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_muc_rtbl.html">Prosody’s mod_muc_rtbl</a> and the pub/sub services that it uses.</p><p>The first version of this plugin is now available <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=mucrtbl">on our website</a> and should become available in the list of installable plugins in your instance of Openfire in the next few hours. Please give it a test! We are interested in hearing back from you!</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/IgniteRealtime">For other release announcements and news follow us on Twitter</a></p><p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p><p><a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/new-openfire-muc-real-time-block-list-plugin/92587">Read full topic</a></p>

            <p>Some of you might already have followed along with the discussion on this in the open_chat chatroom, but: the Ignite Realtime community now has its own Mastodon service at <a href="https://toot.igniterealtime.org">toot.igniterealtime.org</a>! This service is graciously sponsored by <a href="https://www.free-solutions.ch/">Free Solutions Sàrl</a> - a big thank you to Claude and his team!</p><div align="center"><p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76dd6261bc50689758b08810b728ae0d70ad5d3d.png" data-download-href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/uploads/default/76dd6261bc50689758b08810b728ae0d70ad5d3d" title=""><img src="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/76dd6261bc50689758b08810b728ae0d70ad5d3d_2_690x360.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="gXwECzExsAqyXPeGdTYHBv9avvv" width="690" height="360" srcset="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/76dd6261bc50689758b08810b728ae0d70ad5d3d_2_690x360.png, https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/76dd6261bc50689758b08810b728ae0d70ad5d3d_2_1035x540.png 1.5x, https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76dd6261bc50689758b08810b728ae0d70ad5d3d.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/76dd6261bc50689758b08810b728ae0d70ad5d3d_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p></div><p>The idea is to have a Mastodon service with accounts from like-minded people with regards to open source / open standards real time collaboration. That way, both our local as well as federated timelines should become more applicable to us, as the users of this service, as compared to one of the larger, generic servers that are out there. Also, decentralizing by moving away from some of those gigantic services is a Good Thing©®!</p><p>We are inviting our community members to join <a href="http://toot.igniterealtime.org">toot.igniterealtime.org</a>! If you don’t have a Mastodon account yet, or if you want an additional one, or want to migrate your existing account, please join us!</p><p>At least for now, this server is not accepting public sign-ups. While we are gaining experience with running a Mastodon service, we will limit new accounts to people from the community that we recognize. This will largely be based on <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/">the trust levels</a> that software running our forum is assigning to people.</p><p>When you <a href="https://toot.igniterealtime.org/auth/sign_up">sign up on our Mastodon service</a>, please use the same mail address that you used to sign up to our forum, so that we can cross-reference who’s who. It helps if you fill out your forum username in the answer to the “Why do you want to join?” question that’s part of the application. The approval process is manual, so please allow for some time for that to happen. If you think that we’ve missed your request (Mastodon doesn’t always send out notifications, it appears), please let us know by reaching out in the forum, or in the <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/support/group_chat.jsp">open_chat chatroom</a>!</p><p>We are looking forward to hearing from you in the Fediverse!</p><p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p><p><a href="https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/new-mastodon-service-for-the-ignite-realtime-community/92389">Read full topic</a></p>
